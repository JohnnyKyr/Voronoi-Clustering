# Voronoi-Clustering A simple Approach
 
Data: You can input a 2d or 3d data. The parsing might need some changes, "it is on user's hand" :).

Algorithm: The Clustering was made with K-means and the bounding of the clusters with Jarvi's March algorithm

Note: The program does not contain Fortune's Algorithm. That's why it is a simple approach :)
